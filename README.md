# G-SQLite Browser

This my sandbox for testing methods in c with sqlite and gtk.I thought of updating my concepts and testing my methods
in private repositories, but since others could learn too to some extent of what I have been doing, I have decided
to make this public.

######Workflow: Treat master as a development banch as this is a sand box. Other feature branches merges to this.

####History

This is being cloned/forked from [here](http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegtk/), written from scratch and cloned rest by cherry-picking the commits The the first clone/forked point is [4cb3388bce05ec6da4d8eb0f25d7d12af708c5fa](https://code.google.com/p/sqlitegtk/source/detail?r=4cb3388bce05ec6da4d8eb0f25d7d12af708c5fa). You could say I am just "hacking" into it to know how it works, and also updating/fixing its code along the way.
