# sqlitegtk-sandbox
This my sandbox for testing methods in c with sqlite and gtk.I thought of updating my concepts and testing my methods
in private repositories, but since others could learn too to some extent of what I have been doing, I have decided
to make this public.

######Workflow: Treat master as a development banch as this is a sand box. Other feature branches merges to this.
